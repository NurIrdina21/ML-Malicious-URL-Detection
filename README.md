The ensemble model is built using a combination of the best 4 performing 
models. The models evaluated consist of Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest 
Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, KNeighborsClassifier, SGD Classifier, ExtraTrees 
Classifier, GaussianNB, and XGBClassifier. This ensemble approach employs a 
Voting Classifier with hard voting, which combines multiple base models to enhance 
predictive performance. The integration of various models aims to capture a broader 
range of patterns and features associated with malicious URLs, thereby improving the 
detection system's overall performance. The project intends to use an ensemble 
strategy to overcome the limitations of individual models and improve the detection 
system's generalisation capabilities. The use of an ensemble model allows for a more 
thorough understanding of the intricate characteristics of malicious URLs, resulting in 
a more robust defence mechanism against the evolving cyber threats. The ensemble 
model's performance is then evaluated using standard classification metrics such as 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive assessment of its 
effectiveness in detecting malicious URLs in real-world scenarios.
